<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
Cutoff Finder is an easy&ndash;to&ndash;use web application for the determination of cutoff points in molecular data.
Often, molecular data such as gene expression or protein expression data are represented by continuous or at least ordinal variables.
In order to translate these variables into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point and to stratify patients into two groups, each of which requiring a different kind of treatment.
Cutoff Finder offers a multitude of methods for cutoff determination and plots.

<h4>Workflow</h4>

<p>
The data are processed as follows:

<ol>
  <li> The data are uploaded from a tab&ndash;separated File, rows representing patients and columns representing variables.
       Alternatively, one of three example data sets can be imported.
  <li> The user selects the biomarker and optionally outcome and survival variables from the table columns.
  <li> The user selects the method for cutoff determination.
  <li> The user chooses the kinds of plots that should be generated.
  <li> The inquiry is send to the statistical engine R.
       The optimal cutoff point is determined and analysis plots are generated.
  <li> The user is directed to the results webpage, where cutoff point and plots are shown.
